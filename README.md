======================

Some programmers spend their lives developing a single, unique tool or program of extreme complexity. If that's what you're looking for, you came to the wrong place. This repository is simply the place were I dump what I don't need. Help yourselves - but keep in mind piles of random, clustered and unstructured code wait hungrily ahead! You've been warned.

Project Euler
=============

Project Euler is a website which contains various mathematical/computer science problems that can be solved through programming (or lots time, if you have spare). To solve these problems I used MATLAB. The scripts I used for those problems I solved are available here.

The link to the Project Euler site is http://projecteuler.net/ and my username is Asynchrony (http://projecteuler.net/profile/Asynchrony.png)

After running these scripts, check the Variables Window for a variable called 'solution'. This is the answer to the problem. 

NOTES:
	- Problem 361 was a stupid attempt of mine at something hard. Soon I found the meaning of *hard*. I'm definitely coming back to it in future though.
	- Problem 8 wasn't in Matlab format as I thought Matlab didn't support big numbers, but they I discovered the Symbolic Toolpack.
	- I haven't got the files to some simple problems which I solved.

Project Euler
=============

Project Euler is a website which contains various mathematical/computer science problems that can be solved through programming (or lots time, if you have spare). To solve these problems I used MATLAB. The scripts I used for those problems I solved are available here.

The link to the Project Euler site is http://projecteuler.net/ and my username is Asynchrony (http://projecteuler.net/profile/Asynchrony.png)
